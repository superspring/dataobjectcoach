ProtoJS is a set of JavaScript language extensions focusing on the
language itself, rather than trying to overcome browser issues. It's
aim is to increase development productivity, with a minimal overhead
(read: size).

To experience ProtoJS, just point your browser to the examples directory and
take a look around.

Documentation can soon be found @ https://github.com/christophevg/ProtoJS/wiki

If you want to submit an issue, please consult the guidelines @

If you are running a system that has `make` support you can also run our 
automated test suite:

In a nutshell:
$ make
$ make test
...
-----------------------
98 tests run.
0 failed.

REMARK: Sometimes one test fails. It has to do with timing and I have
to fine-tune it. Just run the tests again and it will mostly be gone.
